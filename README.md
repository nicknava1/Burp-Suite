<h1>Scanning for website vulnerabilities using Burp Suite</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Burp Suite is a powerful vulnerability scanner created by PortSwigger. In this project, I'm going to show you how to use this tool to identify a spectrum of vulnerabilities by performing a crawl and audit of a target website. Then, we'll analyze the results together     and explore the different issues discovered during the audit. Finally, I'll show you how to create a report in Burp Suite and present a remediation strategy to tackle the exposures we discovered. Let's get started!</p>

  <p>Note: In order to perform this scan, you will need to have a copy of Burp Suite Professional.</p>
